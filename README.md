This is a terraform provider that lets you provision kibana resources, compatible with v7 of kibana.
For Kibana 7, you need to use branch and release 7.x

## Installation

[Download a binary](https://github.com/disaster37/terraform-provider-kibana/releases), and put it in a good spot on your system. Then update your `~/.terraformrc` to refer to the binary:

```hcl
providers {
  kibana = "/path/to/terraform-provider-kibana"
}
```

See [the docs for more information](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/basics.html).
